IMPLEMENTATION
we can apply CSS in three diffrent ways

internal css
external css

            Selector{
                property : value;
            }
        </style>

3.external css = when structure and style declaration are in the different document we call it as external css.
external css is used in development mode because it is easy to handle, understand and manipulate the document, and one css document can be used for multiple html documents.
